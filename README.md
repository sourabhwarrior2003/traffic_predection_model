# Traffic Prediction Model

This project implements a traffic volume prediction system using a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) neural network in PyTorch. It predicts future traffic counts at specific junctions based on historical traffic data.

## Setup

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and install the required packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy torch matplotlib scikit-learn
```

---

## Usage

### 1. Train the model

```bash
python train.py
```

This script preprocesses the data, trains the GRU model for 10 epochs, and saves the trained weights to `trained_model.pth`.

### 2. Make predictions

```bash
python predict.py
```

This script loads the trained model and predicts the next traffic count based on the latest available data.

### 3. Evaluate and visualize results

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

Evaluates the model on the test dataset, prints Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and plots actual vs predicted traffic counts.

## File Descriptions

- `train.py` â€” Loads dataset, preprocesses data, trains the GRU model, saves weights.
- `predict.py` â€” Loads saved model weights, predicts traffic count for latest data window.
- `evaluate.py` â€” Evaluates model performance and visualizes predictions.
- `models/traffic_gru.py` â€” Defines the GRU model class.
- `utils/preprocess.py` â€” Functions for normalization and sequence creation.
- `utils/visualization.py` â€” Contains plotting functions to visualize results.
- `data/traffic.csv` â€” Raw traffic data used for training and testing.

---

## Notes

- The model uses a sequence length of 10 time steps (configurable).
- Data is normalized using MinMaxScaler before training.
- The prediction outputs are inverse-transformed back to original scale for interpretation.
- Future improvements can include using BiGRU, LSTM, or advanced graph-based models.
